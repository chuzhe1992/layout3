# Contributing to GUI Layout Toolbox
We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We support MATLAB releases
From a single codebase, we support:

- MATLAB releases R2014b to the present
- Containers
  - in figures
  - unparented
  - (soon) in uifigures

## We develop with GitLab
We use GitLab to host code, to track issues and feature requests, and to accept pull requests.

Please ensure that you set your Git `user.name` and `user.email` before committing changes.

## Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes, across releases.
5. Issue that pull request!

## Report bugs using GitLab's issues
We use GitLab issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue.

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

We *love* thorough bug reports.

## Managing issues
We use GitLab [standard labels](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/17563), with additions:

- Type
  - bug (qualifier: confirmed)
  - enhancement (qualifiers: suggestion, discussion)
  - documentation
  - test
  - maintenance
  - support
  - meta
- Priority
  - critical
  - sooner
  - later
  - someday
  - never
- Severity (for bugs)
  - critical (also a priority)
  - normal
  - low
- Stage
  - doing

## Use a consistent coding style
